1. If a box is in a corner and that corner is not the correct storage space,
	then there is a deadlock. 

2. If two adjacent boxes are both along the wall, and both are not in the
	correct storage space, then there is a deadlock.
3. If two adjacent boxes are surrounded by at least two obstacles, and the
	boxes are not in the correct storage space, then there is a deadlock.
4. When two adjacent boxes are in the optimal path of each other, more movement
	is required and there should be a penalty when calculating the heuristic.
5. There should be a penalty for calculating the heuristic for each box that 
	cannot reach any appropriate storage space, without moving other boxes first
